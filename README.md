# MERN Class JavaScript Practice Tasks

This repository contains JavaScript exercises completed during my MERN Stack course with GeeksforGeeks (GFG). Each file demonstrates a different concept or feature in JavaScript and related frontend technologies, including DOM manipulation, event handling, API integration, component logic, and more.

## Project Structure

The following tasks were practiced and saved as either HTML documents with embedded JavaScript, standalone JavaScript files, or JSON configuration files:

## How to Run

- **HTML Documents:**  
  Open the HTML files in any modern web browser to see their working demos.
- **JavaScript Files:**  
  Run these files in your browser console or using Node.js (where applicable) with `node filename.js`.
- **JSON File (`settings`):**  
  This is for storing app settings and can be imported or read into JS tasks needing configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- [Optional] Node.js installed if running `.js` files on backend

## Purpose

These tasks were designed to build foundational JavaScript skills required for MERN stack development, covering:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- API calls
- UI logic
- Data storage and retrieval

## Credits

- Completed as part of MERN Stack training with **GeeksforGeeks**
- All code written for educational and practice purposes
